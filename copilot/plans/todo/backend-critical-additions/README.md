# Backend Critical Additions Plan

This plan tracks backend-critical additions for the DLP Academy workspace and is postponed until the pre-production hardening window.

## Scope

- Identify backend gaps that block reliability, migration safety, and operability.
- Convert gaps into concrete implementation phases.
- Execute and verify changes with explicit review checklists before closure.

## Non-Goals

- Frontend redesign or feature/UI expansion.
- Unrelated refactors outside backend-critical paths.

## Current Status

- Plan state: **TODO (POSTPONED UNTIL PRE-PRODUCTION)**
- Current phase: **Phase 02 — Security/rules hardening checkpoints (PLANNED)**
- Resume trigger: Start this plan before production release hardening.
- Next milestone after resume: Execute `working/pre-production-resume-checklist.md` and restart Phase 02 execution.

- `strategy-roadmap.md` is the source of truth for sequencing and phase status.
