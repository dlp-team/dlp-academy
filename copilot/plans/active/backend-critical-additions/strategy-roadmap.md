# Backend Critical Additions — Strategy Roadmap

## Mission

Stabilize backend-critical flows by formalizing missing infrastructure, safeguards, and operational workflows required for safe iteration.

## Guiding Principles

- Prefer small, reversible backend changes.
- Protect data integrity first.
- Add observability and verification before broad rollout.
- Keep migration and rules workflows repeatable.

## Phase Status

- Phase 00 — Backend baseline and gap inventory: **COMPLETED**
- Phase 01 — Reliability safeguards and validation hooks: **COMPLETED**
- Phase 02 — Security/rules hardening checkpoints: **IN_PROGRESS**
- Phase 03 — Migration operability and rollback readiness: **PLANNED**
- Phase 04 — Review gate and closure evidence: **PLANNED**

## Immediate Next Actions

1. Expand and execute the rules validation matrix against critical permission flows.
2. Define pass/fail criteria and unresolved risk handling for review gate readiness.
3. Draft Phase 03 operability tasks based on Phase 02 validation outcomes.
