# Backend Critical Additions Plan

This plan tracks backend-critical additions for the DLP Academy workspace, with an execution-first lifecycle under `copilot/plans/active`.

## Scope

- Identify backend gaps that block reliability, migration safety, and operability.
- Convert gaps into concrete implementation phases.
- Execute and verify changes with explicit review checklists before closure.

## Non-Goals

- Frontend redesign or feature/UI expansion.
- Unrelated refactors outside backend-critical paths.

## Current Status

- Plan state: **ACTIVE**
- Current phase: **Phase 02 — Security/rules hardening checkpoints (IN_PROGRESS)**
- Next milestone: Define and execute a rules validation matrix for migration-adjacent flows.

## Plan Artifacts

- `strategy-roadmap.md` is the source of truth for sequencing and phase status.
- `phases/` stores detailed phase execution documents.
- `working/` stores notes and draft findings.
- `reviewing/` stores verification checklists and review logs.
