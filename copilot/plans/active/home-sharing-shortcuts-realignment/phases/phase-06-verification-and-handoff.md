# Phase 05 — Verification and Handoff

## Goal
Verify behavior end-to-end and prepare transition from `todo` to `active` and then `inReview`.

## Scope
- Execute checklist in `reviewing/checklist.md`.
- Capture any failures and re-test evidence.
- Confirm no regressions in folder moves, delete, and drag/drop semantics.

## Exit Criteria
- Checklist pass or documented blockers with repro + fix plan.
