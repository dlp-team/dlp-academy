# Phase 01 — Home Duplication Audit (PLANNED)

## Objective
Create a concrete inventory of duplicated logic across Home hooks, handlers, and components.

## Planned changes
- Map repeated branches and helper patterns in Home movement/sharing/filtering flows.
- Document exact symbols and files where duplication appears.
- Rank extraction candidates by regression risk and implementation effort.

## Risks
- Over-scoping refactor candidates too early.
- Missing mode-specific behavior differences hidden behind similar code.
