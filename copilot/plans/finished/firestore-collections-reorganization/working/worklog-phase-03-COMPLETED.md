# Worklog Phase 03 (Completed)

## Summary

Phase 03 consolidated permission behavior required for shortcut-first UX and ownership-safe controls.

## Recovered Outcome Notes

- Owner vs non-owner capability boundaries were clarified in UI/permission checks.
- Shortcut-specific edit rights were aligned with shortcut ownership.
- Read-only/lecture-mode intent remained compatible with share architecture.

## Continuity Note

This worklog was reconstructed after accidental overwrite; it preserves implemented intent and outcome rather than every historical commit-level detail.
