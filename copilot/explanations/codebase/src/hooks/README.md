# README.md

## Purpose
- **Source file:** `src/hooks/README.md`
- **Last documented:** 2026-02-24
- **Role:** Custom hook providing shared state and business logic.

## File Flow (High Level)
- Operates mostly with internal logic and no explicit imports.
- No explicit function declarations were detected; behavior may be declarative/content-only.
- Exposes behavior through the module exports consumed by pages and sibling shared modules.

## Functions Explained
- No explicit function definitions detected in this file.
## Function Relations
- No function/import relations were detectable in this file.

## Imports and Dependencies
- No imports declared.

## Example
```js
// Import this module from: src/hooks/README.md
// Use its exported functions/components where needed in shared flows.
```

## Maintenance Notes
- Keep this explanation updated when adding, renaming, or deleting functions in the source file.
- If imported dependencies change, update the relation mapping and the example snippet accordingly.
