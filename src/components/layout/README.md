# Layout Components

This folder contains structural components that define the "shell" of the application.

- Used to wrap pages or provide consistent navigation/layout.
- No business logic or data fetching.

**Examples:** Header, Sidebar, Footer, AppShell, etc.

If a component is only for layout and is used across the app, it belongs here.
