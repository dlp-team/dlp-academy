# UI Components

This folder contains atomic, reusable UI components ("dumb" components).

- No direct data fetching or business logic.
- Only UI state (hover, focus, etc.)
- Receives all data via props.

**Examples:** Button, Avatar, Toggle, Card, TagFilter, ViewLayoutSelector, etc.

If a component is used in multiple features or pages, it belongs here.
